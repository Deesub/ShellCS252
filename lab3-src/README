PART 1:
Modified the thr1.cc.

3.)On initially running the unmodified thr1, we see that the output will be random generation of A's, B's and C's.
5.)The PRINTC will be called before the threads are reached , hence sending the program into an infinite loop only printing C's


PART 2:


Modified count.cc


PART 3:

							System  (Kernel) Time 	   User Time	     Real Time
pthread_mutex (count)	                                    2.324s		     2.640s		2.492s
spin lock (count_spin with thr_yield)	 	 	    0.192s		     0.612s	        0.449s
spin_lock (count_spin without thr_yield) 	 	    0.000s 	             3.412s		1.708s	



1.)The difference in time is associated with the fact that when pthread_yield is called, there is no check to see if the processor is free, but only when all threads are done their job does anything else get completed
2.)The difference in time is associated with the fact that mutex_lock calls wait.


PART 4: 


deadlock.cc is fixed
